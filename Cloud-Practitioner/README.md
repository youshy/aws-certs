## Cloud Compuiting Models

* IaaS - Infractructure as a Service - basic blocks for building cloud IT (VPC, EC2, EBS)
* PaaS - Platform as a Service - underlying infrastructure managed by AWS, but the frontend has to be managed by the user (RDS, EMR, ElasticSearch)
* SaaS - Software as a Service - complete product run and managed by the service provider (Email, Office 365, Salesforce)
* FaaS - Function as a Service (Abstract Services) - build and run applications without thinking about servers (S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, SNS)

* Glacier - more for archivisation
* EBS - Elastic Block Store
* EFS - Elastic File System - network attached storage
* Storage Gateway - enabled hybrid storage
